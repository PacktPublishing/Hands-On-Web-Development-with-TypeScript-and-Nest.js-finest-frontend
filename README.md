## About the Video Course

Nest.js is a framework for building Node.js server-side applications on top of TypeScript and JavaScript. It helps to build efficient and scalable web applications and keep your code organized and architecturally flexibile.

In this course, you will learn about the fundamentals of Typescript and Nest.js, together with advanced techniques to build a financial dashboard that will display stock prices, variations, and company-specific financial performance. We will be build a REST API to retrieve the financial data server-side. Later, we will focus on building the front end dashboard using Angular and connect it with the Nest.js REST API to fetch data and display it while also adding authentication and authorization via the server. Finally, we will deploy the app and go live via Heroku.

By the end of the course, you will be proficient in using Nest.js to address issues that Node.js canâ€™t solve and use it to build a full-stack TypeScript application with Angular as your front end framework.
